# Wearables-Augment-Senses

## Documentation // Steps to reproduce

1. Mimic the following wiring diagram. 

* I used a 64x48 pixel OLED instead of the one pictured, but they're functionally identical.
* I also used a piezo breakout board instead of manually using resistors as pictured, but either will work fine.
